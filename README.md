# Doing dumb things with TypeScript to solve leetcode problems

Since I'm playing with TypeScript more, learning the ins and outs of the
language, I thought this would be a fun project to tackle. There are a lot of
interesting problems that I can already see and I'll tackle them as I get some
free time and motivation. I hope you enjoy!
